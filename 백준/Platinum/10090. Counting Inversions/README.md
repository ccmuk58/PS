### 문제 설명

<p>A permutation of integers from 1 to n is a sequence a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>, such that each integer from 1 to n is appeared in the sequence exactly once.</p>

<p>Two integers in а permutation form an inversion, when the bigger one is before the smaller one.</p>

<p>As an example, in the permutation 4 2 7 1 5 6 3, there are 10 inversions in total. They are the following pairs: 4–2, 4–1, 4–3, 2–1, 7–1, 7–5, 7–6, 7–3, 5–3, 6–3.</p>

<p>Write program invcnt that computes the number of the inversions in a given permutation.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The value for the number n is written on the first line of the standard input. The permutation is written on the second line: n numbers, delimited by spaces.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Write the count of inversions on the standard output.</p>
